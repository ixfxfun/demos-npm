# ixfx-demos-npm

There are a few versions of the demo repository.

* [ixfx-demos](https://github.com/clinth/ixfx-demos) includes a copy of ixfx. This is useful for working offline and the recommended approach.
* You are here: [ixfx-demos-npm](https://github.com/clinth/ixfx-demos-npm) is meant for running in a hosted environment or using a Node.js build process (also allowing you to use Typescript)
* [ixfx-demos-light](https://github.com/clinth/ixfx-demos-light) is a lightweight version. It uses URL imports for code and is simple to host. This is essentially how the [Glitch version](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ixfx-demos) runs.

## Getting started

* [I want to run a server on my computer and edit locally](./local-machine.md)
* [I want to run things on the cloud](./remote-machine.md)

## Editing

Edit demos under `src`. You can mix and match Javascript and Typescript files.

Do not edit any files under `docs`. These are automatically produced from what is in `src`.
