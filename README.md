# demos-npm

There are a few flavours of the demo repository.

* [demos](https://github.com/ixfxfun/demos) includes a copy of ixfx. This is useful for working offline and the recommended approach.
* You are here: [demos-npm](https://github.com/ixfxfun/demos-npm) is meant for running in a hosted environment or using a Node.js build process (also allowing you to use Typescript)
* [demos-light](https://github.com/ixfxfun/demos-light) is a lightweight version. It uses URL imports for code and is simple to host. This is essentially how the [Glitch version](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ixfx-demos) runs.

Please see the [ixfx docs for more on getting started](https://ixfx.fun/guides/getting-started/)
