# keyboard / remote

This sketch demonstrates sending keyboard events from one device/sketch to another. For example, to have something happen on your mobile phone when a key is pressed on a laptop.

To use, open the 'sender' sketch on the device to send keyboard events, and 'receiver' on the device to receive data. Multiple senders and receivers can be used.

It's also possible to test by opening the sketches in different tabs.

To access across different devices, see [the guide](https://ixfx.fun/reference/websockets/) for more info.
