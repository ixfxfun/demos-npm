# Loading scripts

Ixfx offers the possibility to run simple scripts on an Espruino. However to
make use of modules, it's necessary to use of the [Espruino IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/).

If you want the script to load if the Espruino is power-cycled, ensure the 'Flash' option is chosen when uploading. Otherwise, choose 'RAM'. If battery-powered, its not a nad idea to take it out when you're not usingto avoid
unnecessary battery draining.
