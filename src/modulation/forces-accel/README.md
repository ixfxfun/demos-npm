This sketch demonstrates applying a vector velocity to a point, wrapping the
coordinate based on screen dimensions.

It also demonstrates using `pointTracker` to track pointer movement direction
and use that to interactively change velocity.

See `forces-accel-particles` for a version of this sketch that works with any
number of things.
