[View online](https://demos.ixfx.fun/modulation/jitter/)

Things to try:
* Try using `{ relative: 0.5 }` as the jitter settings and note how the amount of jitter gets smaller when the pointer is in the top-left of the window. This is because the x,y values get smaller, thus the relative jitter amount gets smaller. Contrast that to `{ absolute: 0.5 }`.
