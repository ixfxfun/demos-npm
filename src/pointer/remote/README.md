# pointer-remote

This sketch demonstrates sending pointer events from one device/sketch to another. It's useful if you want to use a mobile device as a multi-touch input for something running elsewhere.

To use, open the 'sender' sketch on the device to send pointer event, and 'receiver' on the device to receive data. Multiple senders and receivers can be used.

It's also possible to test by opening the sketches in different tabs.

To access across different devices, see [_readmes/websockets.md](../../_readmes/websockets.md) for more info.
