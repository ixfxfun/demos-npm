# palm

_Make sure the sender is using the 'hand' model._

We derive a number for the 'palm area'. When facing the camera, this area is maximised. When tilted forward or backward, the area of the palm is reduced.

Uses the 'Things' model, where each thing is modulated by the same palm area value. Since this is modulated by the thing's properties, we get varying effect for each thing.
