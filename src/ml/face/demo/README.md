# face

Make sure the sender is using the 'face' model.

This basic demo demonstrates:
1. Receiving pose data of one or more bodies
2. Deriving data from raw pose data
3. Mapping to screen coordinates
4. Drawing on the canvas.

It is limited because it mirrors the data to the canvas.

We use helper files from `pose-helper`. They shouldn't need to be modified.
